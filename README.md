# Aggressive gap screening rules for faster Lasso-type solvers

This repository hosts the implementation of fast solvers for the Lasso and multi-task Lasso problem.

The algorithms are in ```./a5g/*_fast.pyx```.
Currently implemented are:
* Lasso solver on dense and sparse data
* Multi-task Lasso solver on dense data (aka Group Lasso with groups equal to rows)

The algorithms are written in Cython, using calls to BLAS when possible.
